# Typewriter CSS/JavaScript UI Effect

Based on tutorial by Brad Traversy

I wanted to work with upsplashes API for background images so there is a funky text color.

The text color is to hopfully contrast with whatever random image that pops up. 

If the text is hard to see just refresh your browser. (would not do on a series project)
